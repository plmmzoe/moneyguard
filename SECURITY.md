## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in MoneyGuard, please report it privately. **Do not open a public issue** — issues are visible to everyone and could be used by malicious actors.

**How to report:**

- **GitHub** — Use the **Security** tab of this repository and click **Report a vulnerability** to open a private security advisory, or
- **Email** — Contact the maintainers privately (e.g. via the contact method listed in the repo or your preferred secure channel).

Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any impact you’re aware of. We’ll respond as soon as we can and will keep you updated on the status of the report.

Thanks for helping keep MoneyGuard safe.
