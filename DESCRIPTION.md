# MoneyGuard AI — Project description

**MoneyGuard AI** is an evidence-based behavioral intervention for personal spending. It helps you pause before checkout, understand the impact of a purchase on your budget and goals, and make decisions you’re less likely to regret.

## What it does

- **Intervenes before you buy** — A Chrome extension detects when you’re on checkout-like pages and offers a short “cool-off” and optional AI analysis of your cart (cost vs. monthly budget, regret risk, alternatives).
- **One place for decisions and goals** — The web app gives you a dashboard, spending insight, savings goals, and a single account that stays in sync with the extension.
- **Behavioral nudge, not punishment** — The goal is to create a moment of reflection and clarity, not to block or shame spending. You can always choose to complete the purchase and log it, or skip it and record the amount as “saved” toward a goal.

## Who it’s for

People who want to reduce impulse buying and align spending with their budget and savings goals, without switching to a different app at the moment of purchase. MoneyGuard meets you where you shop (in the browser) and ties that behavior to your existing goals and history in the app.

## In short

Evidence-based behavioral intervention for your wallet: analyze purchase intent in real time, predict regret, and make smarter financial decisions—before you checkout.
